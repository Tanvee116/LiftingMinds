        <p> The rise in mental health issues gave us the inspiration to create this website, wherein, we'd not only raise awareness about such taboo topic, but also help people to heal and deal with their loss amidst COVID-19. So, our main aim is  To develop solutions that can address awareness, early detection, prevention, intervention and treatment opportunities for youth mental health issues. Lifting minds is the name we chose for our website... which means lifting minds towards healthy state of mind and positivity.</p>
