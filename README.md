# Lifting Minds.
 A website aimed to connect people with mental health issues to trained professionals.
## Description ##
The rise in mental health issues gave us the inspiration to create this website, wherein, we'd not only raise awareness about such taboo topic, but also help people to heal and deal with their loss amidst COVID-19. People usually don't diagnose or analyse their mental state because of stigma around it. So, we're giving our part of contribution by encouraging people to start their journey towards a healthy state of mind.
